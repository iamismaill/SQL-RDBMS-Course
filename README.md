# SQL-RDBMS Course

This course is designed for **Semester 4 Computer Science students** at **CITYCOT University** and aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)** and **SQL (Structured Query Language)**. Throughout this course, you will gain a solid understanding of RDBMS concepts, SQL syntax, and querying techniques essential for efficient database management and design.

## What You Will Learn

### 1. **Fundamentals of RDBMS**
   - Understand the core principles of relational databases, their structure, and how they are used in various applications.

### 2. **SQL Concepts**
   - Learn SQL commands and their usage for interacting with databases, including:
     - `SELECT`
     - `INSERT`
     - `UPDATE`
     - `DELETE`
     - and more.

### 3. **Database Design**
   - Explore the process of designing a database, from table creation to defining relationships and constraints.

### 4. **SQL Querying**
   - Master the art of writing complex SQL queries, including filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.

### 5. **Advanced Query Techniques**
   - Gain hands-on experience with:
     - `JOINS`
     - `SUBQUERIES`
     - and other advanced SQL concepts to manipulate and retrieve data from multiple tables.
